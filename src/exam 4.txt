hematocrit
antigen
antibody
diapedesis
chemotaxis

hematocrit - % of volume in RBC
antigen - substance that can bind to a component of the adaptive
 immune sytem, eg; t-lymphocytes or antibodies
antibody - are molecules that can bind to an antigens until the
 immune system is destroyed or removes the antigen, are
 transported in plasma
diapedesis - passage of leukocytes through the intact blood vessel
             when cells move to an open wound
chemotaxis - movement of molecules to a chemical

-99% formed elements 
 round, concave center, lack nucleus + organelles, 1x size, tranport gasses
  o2 and contains hemoglobins
 
-0.01% formed elements
contains nucleus + organelles, 1.5x larger, various immunse response & defends
 against pathogens
 
-1% formed elements

 2 um(1/4s erythrycyte)

 ~
hemoglobins

4 goblins (2 alpha, 2 beta)
4 hemo grous

 ~
life cycle of erythrocyte

no nucleus does not repair
broken down and recycled
1.erythrocytes form in red bone marrow
2.erythrocytes circulate in bloodstream for 120 days
3.aged erythrocytes are phagocytized in the liver and spleen

liver: heme->bile->iron->carried to ferritin->marrow to be used
RBC protein membrane->free amino acids

 Liver Heme - bilirum - bile - iron - carried by ferritin - marrow to be used RBC protein membrane - free amino acids

apex - inferior conical end, projects antiinferiorily to left

 ~
fibrous skeleton

Dense Reg. Tissue, Between Ventricles and Atria. Supports and
anchors valves of heart. Attachment point for heart muscles, insulator of
electrical impulses.

 ~
pericardium

*fibrous parietal pericardium - tough dense ct, in the most superficial
                                layer, anchoring the heart to nearby structures
*serous pericardium - thin, double layer of serous membrane
  parietal layer - serous pericardium that lines the inner surface of the
                   fibrous pericardium
  visceral layer(epicardium)-serous peri. that lines the outer surf. of heart
*pericardial cavity - narrow space between the parietal and visceral layer of
                      the heart

 ~
coronary artery

supplies the right/left border of the heart

 ~
Arterial anastomosis       (Example?)
end artery                 (Example?)
functional end anastomosis (Example?)
companion vessels
vasoconstriction
vasodilation
capillary
capillary bed
metarteriole
precapillary sphincters
thoroughfare channel
post capillary venule
true capillaries

ARTERIAL ANASTOMOSIS
 where 2 or more arteries/veins converge to supply the same body region
 provides alternate blood supply to body,tissue,organ
  eg:circle of willis, coronary arteries, abdominal, joints(plantar arch,
  palmar arch), hands + feet
END ARTERIES
 some arteries do not form anastomosis. so-called "end arteries" provide
 only one pathway through which blood can reach an organ
  eg:kidney-renal artery; spleen splenic artery
FUNCTIONAL END ANASTOMOSIS
 meaning their anastomoses are so tiny they can be considered end arteries
  eg:coronary arteries in the heart
COMPANION VESSELS - art. vein that trav. together. and lie together
 eg:femoral artery + femoral vein
VASOCONSTRICTION - narrowing of blood vessel lumen
VASODILATION - widening of blood vessel lumen, result
CAPILLARY - do not function independently
CAPILLARY BED - a group of capillaries 10-100 
METARTERIOLE - feeds capillary bed, vessel branch of an arteriole. The
 proximal part is encircled by scattered smooth muscle cells
PRECAPILLARY SPHINCTERS - smooth muscle ring, controls blood flow in true cap
THOROUGHFARE CHANNEL - distal part of materiole, smooth muscle
POST CAPILLARY VENULE - thoroughfare chan. conn. to pcv and drains cap. bed
TRUE CAPILLARIES - branch from metateriole, mk up bulk of capillary bed

4 functions of lymphatic system

1. returns interstitial fluids to venous circulation
2. transports lipids from GI tract to bloodstream
3. production and maturation of lymphocyte
4. generates an immune response: T&B lymphoocytes (cells)

 ~
antigen - antigen, antibodieny substance that can bind to a omponent of the adaptive T lymphocytes anti-immune sytem, eg; t-lymphocytes or anti-bodies
antibody - are molecules that can bind tan antigen until the immune system is destroyed or removeantigen, ar
lymph - a liquid mixture of a combination of interstitial fluid solutes, and somteimes foreign material enters lymphatic vessels.

cisterna chyli, immunocompetency, germinal center, Peyer Patch
 
lymph - liquid mixture of a combination of interstitial fluid, solutes, and sometimes foreign material enters the lymphatic vessels
Chyle - milky color due to lipid lymph e - milky color due to lipids, lydrained GI tract
lacteal - In the small intestine, each villus usually contains a single, blind-ended, central lymphatic capillary called a lacteal.
 
 Lacteals are responsible for absorbing dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins.
 Tiny vessel that transports lymph with lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins from the small intestine.
 
afferent lymphatic vessels -  transports lymph to a lymph node where it is filtered for a foreing or pathogenic antigen
efferent lymphatic vessels - is where a lymph node is filtered and the lymph node exits to
cisternae chyli - at the base of the thoracic duct and anterior to l2 vertebrae is a rounded, saclike structure
immunocompetency - immune system is working properly
germinal centers - have invaginated outer edges called crypts
peyer patch - collection of lymphoid nodules can become quite large into the gut lumne
